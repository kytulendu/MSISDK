# Matrox Simple Interface (MSI) SDK

A basic native 3D graphic API for Matrox Mystique (MGA-1064SG) and
Matrox Mystique 220 (MGA-1164SG) graphic card. Develop by Matrox.

The API supported a maximum of 640x480x16 resolution with hardware Z-buffer,
Gouraud Shaded and Textured triangles, special case Zplanes, etc.
but no texture filtering, mipmapping, crude alpha-blending and environmental
mapping emulation.

There are two version of MSI SDK in this reposity, one is version 1.06
for DOS, which required Watcom C/C++ 10.6 and DOS4GW, other one is
version 1.10 for Windows 9x.
