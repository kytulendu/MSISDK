Cube Rotation Controls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
F1     : Set Rotation in X-Axis AntiClockwise.
F2     : Set Rotation in X-Axis OFF.
F3     : Set Rotation in X-Axis Clockwise.

F4     : Set Rotation in Y-Axis AntiClockwise.
F5     : Set Rotation in Y-Axis OFF.
F6     : Set Rotation in Y-Axis Clockwise.

F7     : Set Rotation in Z-Axis Anticlockwise.
F8     : Set Rotation in Z-Axis OFF.
F9     : Set Rotation in Z-Axis Clockwise.

ENTER  : Toggle Bus Mastering ON/OFF.

UP     : Enlarge the Cube.
DOWN   : Shrink  the Cube.

HOME   : Run Demo for 2 spins (Clockwise in all axis) - Many Calculations.
       : The above really shows off the speed difference with BUS-MASTERING.	
       : This is because the CPU is very busy in doing many calculation while
       : the BUS-MASTERING of the board is taking place concurrently. 		 
END    : Run Demo for 2 spins (Clockwise in all axis) - Maximum Speed.
       : Since there are very few CPU calculations with this case, the
       : BUS-MASTERING doesn't do much for frame rate.

SPACE  : Pause on a Frame.
TAB    : Restart Cube Motion from initial position.

INSERT : Set Gourad Shading mode.
DELETE : Set Texture Mapping mode.
